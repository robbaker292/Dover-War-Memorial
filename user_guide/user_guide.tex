\section{Notes}
Buttons on screen are labelled in \textit{italics}, with text to be entered or displayed in \texttt{monospace}. Any \textit{Edit}, \textit{Add} or \textit{Delete} buttons in screenshots are not displayed if the user is not logged in. Numbers in red, for example \marker{1}, point to a reference of the relevant figure.

\begin{infoBox}
Some information may be of interest and is displayed in this type of box.
\end{infoBox}

\begin{warningBox}
More serious information may be displayed in a box similar to this.

\section{Navigation \& Login}
There are two main menu bars on the site. These are displayed on every single page, with the top bar gaining an extra row when logged in. The text disappears when viewed on mobile, for space reasons. The home page contains the same content as before, along with some dynamic data: a summary of the most recent news article and the names of any casualties that died on this day.

\subsection{What does the Home Page do?}
Figure~\myref{fig:home} shows the home page as viewed when not logged in. \marker{1}\ links back to the home page, \marker{2}\ navigates to the Latest News area (Section~\myref{sec:siteUpdate}), \marker{3}\ to the Casualty Index (Section~\myref{sec:casualtyIndex}), \marker{4}\ to the Articles area (Section~\myref{sec:articles}), \marker{5}\ the Search area (Section~\myref{sec:search}) and \marker{6}\ to the Contact Us page. At the bottom of the page, these links are reproduced, with the addition of \marker{7}, which navigates to the Login page (Section~\myref{ssec:login}). Other areas on the page are the latest news article (\marker{8}), the list of casualties who died today (\marker{9}) and the main narrative (\marker{10}).

\subsection{How do I login?}\label{ssec:login}
To login, click the \textit{Login} button on the bottom menu bar (see \marker{7}\ on Figure~\myref{fig:home}). The login page is then loaded (Figure~\myref{fig:login}), which allows the user to login to the site to make various changes. \marker{1}\ is where the username must be entered with \marker{2}\ being the password field. \marker{3}\ submits this information.

\begin{warningBox}
There is no way of resetting your username or password, so ensure that you remember it

\subsection{How does the Home Page look after Login?}
Once a user has logged in, menu bars change. The top menu bar gains another row, with the login button on the bottom bar being replaced with a logout button, as can be seen in Figure~\myref{fig:home_login}. \marker{1}\ shows the currently logged in user, \marker{2}\ navigates to the config page (Section~\myref{sec:config}) and \marker{3}\ the admin help page (where this document is stored). \marker{4}\ and \marker{5}\ allow the user to logout. \marker{6} allows the user to edit the narrative text. These appear in numerous places across the site.

\section{Site Updates}\label{sec:siteUpdate}
This section of the site contains two areas: Latest News, and a Change Log. The latest news section is for interesting updates and events that you may wish to bring attention to, in a similar way to the current latest news page. The most recent news article is also displayed on the home page.

The Change Log is a list of all the changes on the site (or rather, all the changes when you have entered a description of the change). This allows those visitors who wish to know what exactly is changing and when the ability to do so. It's also quite useful to show that the site is ``fresh'' and being regularly updates.

\subsection{How do I view a List of Updates?}\label{ssec:view_updates}

Navigate to Site Update section, by clicking the \textit{Latest News} link in either menu bar. A list of this year's updates will show, in a similar fashion to Figure~\myref{fig:view_updates}.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
 \includegraphics[width=.9\textwidth]{pics/view_updates.png}
	\caption{List of Site Updates}\label{fig:view_updates}
\end{figure}

\marker{1}\ indicates which year's updates are being shown, with \marker{2}\ providing a link to the change log, described in Section~\myref{ssec:changeLog}. Each update is displayed below that, with \marker{3}\ showing the title (and allowing the user to view an individual update, as in Section~\myref{ssec:view_update}), \marker{4}\ the content of that update and \marker{5}\ the date the site update was posted. \marker{6}\ shows a list of previous years and the number of site updates from those years. Clicking on a year will load the updates from the respective year. \marker{7}\ and \marker{8}\ allow the creation and editing of a site update, which is described in Section~\myref{ssec:edit_update}.

\newpage
\FloatBarrier
\subsection{How do I view a particular Update?}\label{ssec:view_update}
To view a particular update, click on the title of any update on the list of updates (\marker{3}\ in Figure~\myref{fig:view_updates}). A page will load similar to Figure~\myref{fig:view_update}. \marker{1}\ shows the title, \marker{2}\ the content of the update and \marker{3}\ the date the site update was posted. \marker{4}\ allows the user to return to the list of site updates for that year, while \marker{5} allows the user to edit this update, as described in Section~\myref{ssec:edit_update}.

\end{figure}

\marker{1}\ allows the editing of the title of the site update, while \marker{2}\ allows the editing of the main content of the update. An explanation of the buttons around this area is described in Section~\myref{ssec:narrative}. \marker{3}\ shows the date this update was posted on. It is possible to set this in the future - if this is done, the update will not appear in list of updates until this date (for example, you could create a Christmas message that appears on the 25th December, without needing to log on then). A list of future updates is described in Section~\myref{ssec:config}.

\begin{infoBox}
The \texttt{title}, \texttt{content} and \texttt{date posted} fields must all be complete before the site update can be saved
\end{infoBox}

\marker{4}\ will show a slightly different background is this is a ``family update'' in a similar manner to the existing site. \marker{5}\ allows this edit to be recorded in the Change Log, if completed. Creating a new update, or substantially editing one, may be of interest so this field can be completed. For fixing a small typo, it is probably not worth it. \marker{6}\ saves this update, while \marker{7}\ returns to view this update, discarding any changes. \marker{8}\ allows the deletion of an update and is described in Section~\myref{ssec:delete_update}. The \textit{View} and \textit{Delete} buttons are not shown if this is a new memorial.

\section{Casualty Index}\label{sec:casualtyIndex}

The casualty index is the main section of the site, and therefore has a lot of details associated with it. Casualties are grouped into one or more memorials, with a few main ones shown in more prominence on the main memorial list (the same ones that are shown on the old site). Lists of casualties are displayed on each memorial's page. There is also a memorial map, which shows the various memorials on a interactive map. A casualty as the same narrative before, along with their pictures, as well as a section full of data - used to create the relational and searchable database.

\subsection{How do I view a List of all Memorials?}\label{ssec:view_memorials}

An explanation of the buttons around this area is described in Section~\myref{ssec:narrative}. \marker{5}\ identifies a dropdown box that allows the selection of the casualty's civilian status, while \marker{6}\ determines their gender. \marker{7}\ and \marker{8}\ indicate the casualty's date of birth and death. When hovering over these fields, a dropdown is possible that displays a calendar - this may not be too useful for the dates that are likely to be in these fields, however. Next, \marker{9}\ provides a dropdown with a list of potential wars this casualty may have died in, while \marker{10}\ allows the selection of their final resting place. \marker{12}\ provides another dropdown, this time for the service country, with \marker{13}\ allows for the selection of the casualty's place of birth. \marker{14}\ and \marker{15}\ allow for the selection of the Last Known Address and the year that it was known. \marker{16}\ indicates if this casualty was recently imported - if so, a message is displayed to the user informing that the data may not be complete. \marker{17}\ indicates if some details are unknown, and if so, a message is displayed to the user. This replaces the previous method of placing an asterisk next to a casualty's name. \marker{18}\ saves the current casualty and returns to this edit page (this must be completed when creating a new casualty for the other sections to appear), while \marker{19}\ returns to the casualty's page. \marker{34}\ returns to the casualty page without saving while \marker{35}\ deletes this casualty (as shown in Section~\myref{ssec:delete_casualty}).

\section{Articles}\label{sec:articles}
The articles section is the same as the Information Index on the old site. The renaming is mainly because ``Information Index'' doesn't fit into the menu bars, and is a bit snappier.

Information that was on other areas of the site (e.g. the article about the Dover War Memorial, Donate, etc) should be classed as an article, but won't belong in one of the groups that existed on the previous site, and therefore won't be listed on the main Articles page. There is a separate list (see Section~\myref{ssec:config}) of Articles which do not belong in any category.

\subsection{How do I Add or Edit an Article?}\label{ssec:edit_article}
To create a new article, use the \textit{Add} button on the list of articles (\marker{6}\ of Figure~\myref{fig:view_articles}). To edit an article, click the \textit{Edit} button next to the title of the article (\marker{4}\ on Figure~\myref{fig:view_article}). Both methods will load a similar page, with the differences being that an Edit page will have boxes filled with data and will not have a \textit{View} or \textit{Delete} button, as can be seen in Figure~\myref{fig:edit_article}.

\end{figure}

\marker{1}\ indicates the title of the article, while \marker{2}\ contains the narrative content for this article. An explanation of the buttons around this area is described in Section~\myref{ssec:narrative}. The date the article was posted is shown by \marker{3}\ and the category by \marker{4}. If no category is specified, the article will not appear on the Information Index, but may be linked to from elsewhere. \marker{5}\ allows this edit to be recorded in the Change Log, if completed. Creating a new update, or substantially editing one, may be of interest so this field can be completed. For fixing a small typo, it is probably not worth it. \marker{6}\ saves the changes to the article, while \marker{7}\ returns to view the article with the changes unsaved. \marker{8} allows the deletion of this article, as described in Section~\myref{ssec:delete_article}.

\subsection{How do I delete an Article?}\label{ssec:delete_article}

To delete an article, navigate to its edit page, as described in Section~\myref{ssec:edit_article}. Using the \textit{Delete Article} button (\marker{8}\ in Figure~\myref{fig:edit_article}), will display a warning message similar to Figure~\myref{fig:delete_article}. Clicking on \textit{Cancel} (\marker{1}) will ignore this message, while \marker{2}\ will delete the article.

\begin{warningBox}
Deletions cannot be undone

\section{Search}\label{sec:search}

Searching is one of the big new features of the site. By having data stored and connected in a database, searching because easy, efficient and powerful. There are two main ways of searching: text and data.

Text searches will find pieces of text within the narrative section of a casualty, article, site update, or memorial. Narratives are ranked according to some notion of usefulness.

Data searches allow casualties to be filtered by various pieces of data, for example, all those born on a certain date. Only casualties can be searched by data. The results of this will be much improved once all casualties have had their data added.

\subsection{How do I perform a Text Search?}\label{ssec:text_search}

Text searches are similar to the search already available on the site. Navigate to the Search area by clicking the \textit{Search} button on either menu bar.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
 \includegraphics[width=.9\textwidth]{pics/text_search.png}
	\caption{Performing a Text Search}\label{fig:text_search}
\end{figure}

\marker{1}\ indicates the area to enter the search term, \marker{2}\ allows the user to select which areas of the site to search, and \marker{3}\ performs the search. The text based search is very powerful and can perform more than simple searches. Some main tips for use are displayed below \footnote{More examples are here: \texttt{https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/fulltext-boolean.html}, although the ranking is modified to boost casualties whose names contain any of the search terms}:

\begin{itemize}
\item Search terms are case insensitive.
\item Multiples words are treated as an ``or'' search - i.e. \texttt{dover war} will return all narratives containing \texttt{dover} or \texttt{war} or both.
\item Placing text within quote marks will search for those terms exactly.
\item Place a \texttt{+} in front of a word to ensure that word must be in results.
\item Place a \texttt{-} in front of a word to ensure that word must not be in results.
\item Place a \texttt{>} in front of a word to increase the relevance of that word.
\item Place a \texttt{<} in front of a word to decrease the relevance of that word.
\item Place a \texttt{*} to perform a wildcard search.  For example \texttt{Brit*} would return results for  \texttt{Britain}, \texttt{British}, and so on.
\item Common words (called ``stop words'', for example \texttt{the}, \texttt{at}) are ignored from the search.
\end{itemize}

Details of results are displayed in Section~\myref{ssec:view_search}.

\subsection{How do I perform a Data Search?}\label{ssec:data_search}
The main new feature of the search page, is the data search. This allows a user to search for all casualties who have a particular piece of data, for example, all those born on the same date, or all those who served in the Royal Navy. To view the full list of data items, click on \marker{1}\ in Figure~\myref{fig:data_search}.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
 \includegraphics[width=.9\textwidth]{pics/data_search.png}
	\caption{Performing a Data Search}\label{fig:data_search}
\end{figure}

\marker{2}, \marker{3}, and \marker{4}\ allow the user to specify the name for the desired casualties. \marker{5}\ allows the specification of whether the casualties are civilians, while \marker{6}\ specifies their gender. \marker{7}\ and \marker{8}\ allow the user to specify the dates of birth and death respectively, while \marker{9}\ specifies the War. The final resting place for the casualties is shown by \marker{10}, with the rank at death being identified by \marker{11}. \marker{12}\ indicates the service country to be search, while \marker{13}\ shows the place of birth. The Last Known Address and the year of that address can be specified in \marker{14}\ and \marker{15}. \marker{16}\ allows the specification of any memorials the casualties may be commemorated on, with \marker{17}\ indicating the regiment / service and \marker{18}\ the service number. The search can be completed by clicking \marker{19}. Details of results are displayed in Section~\myref{ssec:view_search}.

\newpage
\FloatBarrier
\subsection{How do I view the Search Results?}\label{ssec:view_search}
Completing the either the text search (see Section~\myref{ssec:text_search}) or data search (see Section~\myref{ssec:data_search}) will display the results further down the page, as can be seen in Figure~\myref{fig:view_search}.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
 \includegraphics[width=.9\textwidth]{pics/view_search.png}
	\caption{Viewing Search Results}\label{fig:view_search}
\end{figure}

The list of numbers indicated by \marker{1}\ shows how many pages of results have been found, and which page is currently being viewed. \marker{2}\ indicates the type of result found, with \marker{3}\ showing the title of that result. Clicking this will navigate to the relevant article, memorial, casualty or site update. \marker{4}\ shows a preview of the results, with the search term highlighted.

If no search results can be found, the list of results will be displayed in a similar manner to Figure~\myref{fig:no_search}.
